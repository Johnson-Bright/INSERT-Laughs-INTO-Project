# INSERT-Laughs-INTO-Project
This project demonstrates the power of  SQL Window Functions on a fictional "Sales Dataset". Using queries enriched with `LAG()`, `LEAD()`, `RANK()`, `DENSE_RANK()`, `ROW_NUMBER()`, and aggregate functions, we explore how modern SQL can simplify complex analytics with humor and clarity

ðŸ“˜ Introduction
Welcome to INSERT Laughs INTO Project â€“ a SQL-based exploration of window functions using a fictional yet realistic Sales Dataset. This project was designed to help us dive deep into powerful SQL analytical tools such as LAG(), LEAD(), RANK(), DENSE_RANK(), ROW_NUMBER(), and aggregate functions with PARTITION BY.

We built this project not only to demonstrate technical understanding but also to highlight how these functions apply to real-world business scenarios â€” all while having a bit of fun with a punny group name ðŸ˜„.
